Bugs
====

There's bound to be some. I have tried to get rid of most of them but
I'm such a nice user I never put the program against the wall and
whip it until it pleads for mercy.

If you find a bug then please report it to

mr_richardson@cix.compulink.co.uk


Known Bugs:
===========

version 1.1
-----------
In the AVFM.VFS file, the version number used is the program version
number and not the file system version number. Let's just call that a
feature for now and hope no-one notices (oops)

The text in the comments and args box is concatenated and not
properly spread across the 3 lines (try writing on two lines and you
will see what I mean). This isn't really a bug, I just haven't
written that routine yet. I will do, and probably soon, but it may
not reach this version. You could always space the lines out if you
needed to! (sorry for the inconvenience)

With let 'em fly some of the dialogues are left behind :[

With Mag!X some of the screen re-draws are a bit dodgy.

The drawing of the text in the window isn't calculated as well as it
could be, sometimes the last item isn't shown on screen fully but you
can't scroll to view it. (if this happens then try re-sizing the
window, sorry but I'll fix it soon)



Fixed Bugs:
===========

version 1.1 
-----------
In medium res the window went off the screen, not sure
why, but I added checks to make sure that the default window size
wasn't more than the size of the screen (if it is then it uses the
screen size instead).

Cut and paste now works with documents properly (Thanx Denesh)
